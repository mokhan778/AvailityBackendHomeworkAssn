1. Tell me about your proudest professional achievement.  It can also be a personal or school project.  

My proudest achievement is perservering through and getting my bachelors degree in computer science. I decided to pursue computer science in my sophomore year of college after being at a crossroads of what I wanted to major in and I chose computer science at the reccomendation of my cousin. Since this was my first time I was ever exposed to computer science and coding, I was far behind the rest of my colleagues in knowledge and credits. It was a major struggle for me at first as I was putting in many extra hours teaching myself the fundamentals of java and many other concepts. Also because computer science was such a credit intensive major and I started to pursue it in my sophomore year of college, I was taking many extra credits during the semester and even during the summer in order to catch up. In the end, I was able to graduate on time with a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science. The degree is much more than a piece of paper to me. It is a symbol of my struggles and perserverance in becoming who I am today.

2. Tell me about something you have read recently that you would recommend and why. (Can be a Github Repo, Article, Blog, Book, etc) 

Recently I have read a book called "I Will Teach You To Be Rich" by Ramit Sehti. From the title, one might assume it's a book about quick and easy ways to make money. However, the books focus is teaching you how to manage your money in a smart and effective way. It has strategies on investing for retirement, budgeting, automating your finances, etc. This book was especially helpful for me because I grew up in a first generation immigrant family. I was not taught the important financial fundamentals such as investing in your 401k for retirement or sticking to a budget that would not only save me money but also allow me to keep doing the things I love and have a fulfilling life. Overall, it's one of the most useful and practical books I have ever read and I would definitely reccomend it to everyone.

3. How would you explain to your grandmother what Availity does?
